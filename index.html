		<h1>Jordan Borth</h1>
		<h2>User Interface Designer</h2> 
<p>I design interfaces for digital products, with a focus on tools and utilities for the Mac and iOS. I strive to design products that get the details right, that feel great to use and that meet my own meticulous standards and expectations. I leave my ego at the door, research and talk with people, share early and often and constantly iterate in order to arrive at the best solution possible.</p>

<p>I believe in less, but better and that simple and intentional design improves our lives.</p>

<hr />

<p><s>I'm a UI designer at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211102143347/https://quill.chat/" title="Quill.Chat">Quill</a> where we believe messaging built for productivity, not engagement, is the future of real‑time work communication.</s></p> 

<p>Quill was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211208175318/https://quill.chat/updates/" title="Twitter-aquisition">acquired by Twitter</a> in December 2021, where I currently work as a Senior Product Designer.</p>

<p>In the past, I’ve had the pleasure of working with great companies and clients including: MetaLab, Square, Flinto, AppZapper, BuddyBuild and CloudApp.</p>
